A Flutter application with automated build and deployment pipeline using Codemagic CI/CD. This project demonstrates how to automatically build and upload APKs to Google Drive for easy distribution to testers and stakeholders.

## Features

- **Automated Builds**: Continuous integration with Codemagic
- **Google Drive Integration**: Automatic APK uploads to Google Drive
- **Version Tracking**: Date-stamped APK files for easy version management
- **Secure Authentication**: Service account authentication with Google APIs

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses Codemagic for continuous integration and delivery with the following workflow:

1. Code is pushed to the main branch
2. Codemagic automatically triggers a build
3. Flutter APK is generated
4. APK is uploaded to Google Drive using a service account
5. Build artifacts are available in Codemagic dashboard

> ðŸ“š **Detailed Guide**: For a comprehensive step-by-step guide on setting up the Google Drive integration, see our [Complete CI/CD Setup Guide](./GUIDE.md).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Google Cloud account
- Codemagic account
- Git

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Setting Up CI/CD Pipeline

#### Google Cloud Setup

1. Create a Google Cloud project
2. Enable the Google Drive API
3. Create a service account with appropriate permissions
4. Generate and download a JSON key for the service account
5. Share your Google Drive folder with the service account email

#### Codemagic Setup

1. Add your project to Codemagic
2. Create an environment variable group named "SECRET"
3. Add your service account JSON as `GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (mark as secure)
4. Configure your workflow using the provided `codemagic.yaml`
